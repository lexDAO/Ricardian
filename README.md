# Ricardian
An entirely on-chain representation of limited liability companies minted as NFTs, governed by [LexDAO](https://twitter.com/lex_DAO) as a public good for ethereum business. The name and concept of Ricardian LLC is inspired by "[ricardian contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract)", *i.e.*, agreements that are recorded with legal and code-based efficacy.

*Quickstart:* 🤳

If you send `0` ETH to ricardianllc.eth, a registration NFT will be recorded and sent to your wallet.
